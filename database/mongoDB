document - written content

----
Document
A document is a record(data) in a document database.
document in database is stored in json like format, in key(attribute/field), value(associated value: string, number, array, sub-document) pairs structure.
collections: group of related documents
fields: individual key value pairs

Key characteristics of a document include:
1. Structured Data: A document is a structured data object that can contain various key-value pairs. Each key represents a field or attribute, and the associated value can be of different data types, such as strings, numbers, arrays, or even sub-documents.
2. JSON-Like Format: Documents in document-oriented databases are typically stored in a format similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). This format is easy for both humans and machines to read and understand.
3. No Fixed Schema: Unlike relational databases where tables have a predefined schema, document-oriented databases do not enforce a fixed schema for documents within a collection. Each document in a collection can have different fields or structures, giving developers flexibility when working with evolving data.
4. Self-Contained: Documents are often designed to be self-contained, meaning that all the information related to a specific entity or object is stored within a single document. This can make it easier to retrieve and update data without the need for complex joins or relationships.
5. Collections: Documents are typically organized into collections (analogous to tables in relational databases). Collections are groups of related documents. For example, in a blogging application, you might have a "posts" collection, and each document in that collection represents a single blog post.
6. Atomic Operations: Most document-oriented databases support atomic operations on documents. This means that when you update a document, the entire update operation either succeeds or fails as a single atomic unit, ensuring data consistency.
7. Scalability: Document-oriented databases, like MongoDB, are designed to be horizontally scalable, making them suitable for handling large volumes of data and high traffic loads. Sharding, replication, and other techniques are used to achieve this scalability.

Overall, documents in document-oriented databases provide a flexible and versatile way to store and retrieve data, especially when dealing with semi-structured or unstructured data, as they don't require a fixed schema definition and can adapt to changing data requirements.

mongoDB
MongoDB is a open-source, NoSQL database management system known for its flexibility and scalability. It falls under the category of document-oriented databases. Here are some key characteristics and concepts related to MongoDB:
1. Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in a format called BSON (Binary JSON), which is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. Each document can have a different structure, making it flexible for storing unstructured or semi-structured data.
2. Collections: MongoDB stores documents in collections, which are similar to tables in a relational database. Collections are schema-less, meaning that documents within a collection can have different fields and structures.
3. Documents: A document in MongoDB is a set of key-value pairs, similar to a JSON object. Documents are the basic unit of data in MongoDB and can represent various types of data, such as customer records, product information, or log entries.
4. Fields: Fields are the individual key-value pairs within a document. Each field has a name and a value, which can be of various data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, and sub-documents.
5. Indexes: MongoDB supports indexing to improve query performance. You can create indexes on specific fields in a collection to speed up searches and sorting operations.
6. Queries: MongoDB provides a powerful query language for retrieving data from collections. You can query documents using operators like `$eq` (equals), `$gt` (greater than), `$lt` (less than), and many more.
7. Aggregation Framework: MongoDB has an extensive aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data transformations, filtering, grouping, and computation operations on your data. (aggregation - converting multiple data elements or records to single summary result)
8. Replication: MongoDB supports data replication, allowing you to create multiple copies of your data across multiple servers (nodes). This provides data redundancy and high availability.
9. Sharding: Sharding is a technique in MongoDB for distributing data across multiple servers or clusters. It's used to horizontally scale MongoDB databases for large-scale applications.
10. Transactions: Starting from MongoDB version 4.0, MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, which allows you to perform multiple operations on documents in a transactional manner, ensuring data consistency.
11. Community and Enterprise Editions: MongoDB offers both a free and open-source Community Edition and a paid Enterprise Edition with additional features and support.
12. Drivers and Libraries: MongoDB provides official and community-supported drivers and libraries for various programming languages, making it accessible for developers in different technology stacks.

MongoDB is commonly used in a variety of applications, including web and mobile applications, content management systems, e-commerce platforms, and data analytics. Its flexibility and scalability make it a popular choice for managing and storing large volumes of diverse data.

------
sharding
Shard: A shard is a subset of data in the database. Each shard is hosted on a separate physical or virtual server, often referred to as a shard server or shard node. Shards are distributed in a way that ensures balanced data distribution and even query and write load.

Shard Key: The shard key is a field or combination of fields in the data that determines how data is partitioned across shards. It is essential to choose an appropriate shard key to evenly distribute data and distribute queries across the shards effectively.

query router: routes/directs queries to appropriate shard

binary JSON (BSON)
binary encoded JSON ( char -> ascii -> binary) (A -> 65 -> 1000001)
BSON, which stands for "Binary JSON," is a binary-encoded serialization format used in MongoDB and some other databases and data interchange formats. BSON is designed to be more efficient for storage and data exchange in certain situations compared to plain text JSON. Here are some key points about BSON:
1. Binary Encoding: BSON represents JSON-like data in a binary format, which is more compact and efficient for storage and transmission over networks compared to the plain text format of JSON.
2. Data Types: BSON supports various data types, including strings, numbers (integers and floating-point), Booleans, arrays, sub-documents, dates, binary data, regular expressions, and more. These data types map closely to those in JSON, but BSON adds additional types like 32-bit and 64-bit integers for better compatibility with programming languages.
3. Ordered Elements: BSON maintains the order of elements within a document, whereas JSON does not guarantee element order preservation.
4. Length Prefix: BSON includes a length prefix for each element, making it easier and more efficient to parse the binary data because it allows for skipping over elements when needed.
5. Null Termination: BSON uses null bytes (0x00) to terminate strings, which makes string manipulation more efficient.
6. Efficiency: BSON's binary format is designed for efficient serialization and deserialization, which can be advantageous when working with large volumes of data, as in database systems.
7. MongoDB: MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, uses BSON as its primary data storage format. When you insert or retrieve data from MongoDB, it's typically converted to/from BSON behind the scenes. This binary format allows MongoDB to store and retrieve documents with a wide variety of data types while maintaining performance.

Here's a simple example of BSON compared to JSON for representing a document:
JSON:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```
BSON (hexadecimal representation):
```
310000006e616d650a0000004a6f686e20446f6504000000636974790a0000004e657720596f726b00
```
While BSON is primarily used within MongoDB, it can also be used in other scenarios where binary serialization and efficiency are important, such as in data interchange formats or network protocols. However, for human-readable data interchange, JSON remains a more common choice due to its simplicity and widespread support.

----
Binary encoding is a method of representing data in a binary (base-2) format, as opposed to a human-readable format like text (ASCII or Unicode). In binary encoding, data is represented using only two symbols: typically 0 and 1.

serial: continues set
----
ASCII to binary:
ASCII characters can be represented as binary numbers by using their ASCII values. Here's how to convert ASCII to binary and vice versa:
ASCII to Binary:
To convert an ASCII character to its binary representation, follow these steps:
1. Find the ASCII value of the character you want to convert. You can use an ASCII table or a programming language's built-in functions to do this. For example, in JavaScript, you can use the `charCodeAt()` method:
   ```javascript
   const asciiValue = 'A'.charCodeAt(0); // Get the ASCII value of 'A' ->  65 decimal representation
   ```
2. Convert the ASCII value to its binary representation. You can use the `toString(2)` method in many programming languages to do this:
   ```javascript
   const binaryRepresentation = asciiValue.toString(2); // 1000001
   ```
Now, `binaryRepresentation` contains the binary representation of the ASCII character 'A', which is "1000001" in binary.
Binary to ASCII:
To convert a binary representation back to an ASCII character, reverse the process:
1. Take the binary number you want to convert. For example, "1000001."
2. Convert the binary number to its decimal equivalent. Many programming languages provide a `parseInt()` function for this purpose:
   ```javascript
   const decimalValue = parseInt(binaryRepresentation, 2);
   ```
3. Convert the decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character using the `String.fromCharCode()` method (in JavaScript) or equivalent functions in other programming languages:
   ```javascript
   const asciiCharacter = String.fromCharCode(decimalValue);
   ```
Now, `asciiCharacter` contains the ASCII character corresponding to the binary representation "1000001," which is 'A'.

You can repeat these steps for each character in a string if you want to convert an entire string from ASCII to binary or vice versa. Keep in mind that ASCII values are typically represented as 7 or 8-bit binary numbers, depending on whether extended ASCII is used.

document- key-value pairs
collection- group of documents
database- container for collections
Fields- is the key

In the context of databases, particularly in NoSQL databases like MongoDB, these terms have specific meanings:
1. Database:
   - A database is a high-level container that holds one or more collections.
   - It serves as a logical grouping or namespace for data.
   - In MongoDB, you can think of a database as similar to a database in a traditional relational database management system (RDBMS). However, it's worth noting that MongoDB is schema-less, meaning that individual collections within a database can have varying structures.
2. Collection:
   - A collection is a grouping of MongoDB documents.
   - It's conceptually similar to a table in an RDBMS, but it doesn't enforce a fixed schema. This means that documents within a collection can have different fields and structures.
   - Collections are used to store related data, and they exist within a specific database.
3. Document:
   - A document is a basic unit of data in MongoDB.
   - It's similar to a row in an RDBMS or a record in other database systems.
   - Documents in MongoDB are represented in BSON (Binary JSON), which is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like data.
   - Each document can have a different structure, and it consists of key-value pairs. The keys are field names, and the values can be of various data types, such as strings, numbers, arrays, or even other documents.
4. Fields:
   - Fields are the individual key-value pairs within a document.
   - Each field has a name and a corresponding value.
   - Fields can hold data of various types, including strings, numbers, arrays, sub-documents, dates, and more.
   - Fields represent attributes or properties of the document's data.

Here's a simple example to illustrate these concepts:
Let's say you have a MongoDB database for a blog application:
- Database: `BlogAppDB` - This is the top-level container for all the data related to your blog application.
- Collections:
   - `Posts` - A collection for storing individual blog posts. Each document in this collection represents a blog post.
   - `Users` - A collection for storing user information. Each document represents a registered user.
   - `Comments` - A collection for storing comments on blog posts. Each document represents a comment.
- Documents:
   - In the `Posts` collection, each document represents a blog post. For example:
     ```json
     {
       "_id": ObjectId("5f6a7b603e03076a4b6d08a1"),
       "title": "Introduction to MongoDB",
       "author": "John Doe",
       "content": "MongoDB is a NoSQL database...",
       "tags": ["MongoDB", "NoSQL", "Database"]
     }
     ```
   - In the `Users` collection, each document represents a user. For example:
     ```json
     {
       "_id": ObjectId("5f6a7b603e03076a4b6d08a2"),
       "username": "johndoe",
       "email": "john@example.com",
       "age": 30
     }
     ```
- Fields: In the documents above, fields include `"title"`, `"author"`, `"content"`, `"tags"` in the `Posts` collection and `"username"`, `"email"`, `"age"` in the `Users` collection. Each field contains a specific piece of data.

mongodb architecture
MongoDB's architecture is designed to be flexible, scalable, and capable of handling a wide range of data storage and retrieval requirements. Here's an overview of the key components and concepts in MongoDB's architecture:
1. Database: In MongoDB, data is organized into databases. Each database can contain multiple collections. A database is a logical container for data, similar to a database in a traditional relational database management system (RDBMS).
2. Collection: A collection is a group of documents stored in MongoDB. It's similar to a table in an RDBMS but with a schema-less structure. Documents within a collection can have different fields and structures.
3. Document: A document is a basic unit of data in MongoDB. It is a JSON-like data structure that can contain key-value pairs. Documents are stored in collections and represent individual records or objects.
4. Field: Fields are individual key-value pairs within a document. Each field has a name and a value. Values can be of various data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, or even sub-documents.
5. Index: Indexes are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations. MongoDB supports various types of indexes, including single-field and compound indexes. Indexes can be created on specific fields to speed up queries and sorting.
6. Replica Set: A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain copies of the same data. Replica sets provide data redundancy and high availability. If one server fails, another can take over, ensuring continuous operation.
7. Sharding: Sharding is a technique for distributing data across multiple servers or clusters. It's used to horizontally scale MongoDB databases for handling large datasets and high traffic loads. Each shard is a separate MongoDB instance.
8. Mongod: A "mongod" is the primary daemon process for MongoDB. It's responsible for managing data storage, processing queries, and handling client requests. A MongoDB deployment typically consists of multiple mongod processes.
9. Config Server: In sharded clusters, config servers store metadata about the data distribution across shards. These servers help the MongoDB cluster route queries efficiently.
10. Query Router (mongos): In a sharded cluster, the query router, or "mongos," is responsible for directing client requests to the appropriate shard(s) based on the sharding key. It acts as a proxy between clients and the sharded cluster.
11. Aggregation Framework: MongoDB includes a powerful aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data transformations, filtering, grouping, and computation operations on your data.
12. Security: MongoDB provides various security features, including authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and encryption at rest and in transit.

distributed database
subset of data are stored in nodes
A distributed database is a database system that spreads data across multiple nodes or servers in a network. Unlike traditional centralized databases where all data is stored in a single location, distributed databases distribute data to improve performance, availability, and scalability. Here are some key characteristics and concepts associated with distributed databases:
1. Data Distribution: In a distributed database, data is partitioned and stored on multiple nodes. Each node may contain a portion of the overall dataset. Data distribution can be done in various ways, such as horizontal partitioning (sharding) or vertical partitioning (columnar stores).
2. Replication: To enhance data availability and fault tolerance, distributed databases often employ data replication. Copies of data are stored on multiple nodes to ensure that if one node fails, data can still be accessed from other replicas.
3.Scalability: Distributed databases can be scaled horizontally by adding more nodes to the network. This allows them to handle increased data loads and user traffic. Scaling can be done dynamically as the system's needs change.
4. High Availability: Distributed databases are designed for high availability. Even if one or more nodes fail, the system can continue to operate, ensuring data accessibility. Replication and redundancy are key components of achieving high availability.
5. Consistency Models: Distributed databases must maintain data consistency, which refers to ensuring that all nodes in the system provide the same view of the data. Various consistency models, such as strong consistency and eventual consistency, are used to manage this aspect.
6. Data Partitioning: Partitioning is the process of dividing the data into subsets and distributing them across nodes. Effective data partitioning is critical for optimizing query performance in distributed systems.
7. Data Access: Users and applications can access data in a distributed database through query languages and APIs. Distributed databases often provide mechanisms for routing queries to the appropriate nodes, abstracting the complexity of data distribution from users.
8. Transaction Management: Distributed databases support distributed transactions to maintain data consistency across multiple nodes. This ensures that a series of operations either succeeds entirely or fails entirely, even if they involve multiple nodes.
9. Data Synchronization: Distributed databases must manage data synchronization and conflict resolution when multiple replicas of the same data are updated concurrently. Strategies like timestamp-based conflict resolution or last-write-wins can be employed.
10. Load Balancing: Load balancing ensures that requests are distributed evenly across nodes to prevent overloading specific nodes and ensuring optimal performance.
11. Security and Access Control: Distributed databases implement security measures like authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect data in a distributed environment.
12. Global Distribution: Some distributed databases are designed to be globally distributed, allowing data to be stored in data centers around the world. This enhances data locality and reduces latency for users in different geographic regions.
13. Management and Monitoring: Distributed databases often come with tools for management, monitoring, and administration, making it easier to maintain and troubleshoot the distributed environment.

Examples of distributed databases include Google's Bigtable, Amazon DynamoDB, Apache Cassandra, and various NoSQL databases like MongoDB when used in a sharded or clustered configuration. Distributed databases are commonly used in scenarios where data needs to be highly available, scalable, and resilient to hardware failures, such as web applications, e-commerce platforms, and large-scale data processing systems.

MMAPv1 - storage engine for mongoDB based on mapped files

Memory mapping: file or part of file is directly mapped to memory
Memory mapping and memory-mapped files are concepts related to computer memory management and file I/O. They provide a way for processes to efficiently work with files by mapping them directly into memory. Here's an explanation of these terms:
1. Memory Mapping:
   - Memory mapping is a technique used in operating systems to map a section of a file or the entire file into the computer's memory. It essentially creates a direct, virtual link between a file or device and a region of memory.
   - This memory mapping process is facilitated by the operating system's memory management unit (MMU). It allows programs to access the content of the file as if it were an array in memory.
   - Memory mapping can be used for various purposes, such as reading and writing files, sharing data between processes, and even executing code stored in memory-mapped files (as is the case with shared libraries and executables on many operating systems).
   - Memory mapping can significantly improve file I/O performance because data can be read or written directly from/to memory, reducing the need for explicit read and write operations between the program and the file.
2. Memory-Mapped Files:
   - Memory-mapped files are files that have been mapped to a region of memory through memory mapping. In other words, when a file is memory-mapped, it appears in memory as if it's part of the program's address space.
   - Memory-mapped files are often used for I/O operations, such as reading and writing, because they allow data to be efficiently transferred between memory and the file without the need for explicit read and write calls. Instead, the data is accessed as if it were in memory.
   - When a memory-mapped file is modified in memory, the changes can be written back to the file on disk, thus providing a seamless and efficient way to work with data.
   - Memory-mapped files are particularly useful for large files, as they avoid the need to load the entire file into memory. Only the parts of the file that are accessed are loaded into memory on demand.
   - Memory-mapped files are commonly used in various applications, including databases, text editors, and operating systems themselves.

In summary, memory mapping and memory-mapped files are techniques that allow files to be efficiently accessed and manipulated in memory, providing performance benefits, especially for large datasets or when multiple processes need to access the same data.

instance = process or thread

----
mongoDB instance - 
running MongoDB process/ single running thread of mongoDB software
manages database operations and processes queries
stores data in a specified data directory as data files(which includes collection, indexes and system data files)
listens on specific network port and an ip address

In the context of MongoDB, an "instance" typically refers to a running MongoDB server process. A MongoDB instance is an independent server process that manages data storage, retrieval, and various database operations. Here are some key points about MongoDB instances:
1. Independence: Each MongoDB instance operates independently, even when multiple instances are part of a replica set or sharded cluster. This means that each instance has its own resources, memory, and storage.
2. Processes and Daemons: A MongoDB instance is started as a process or daemon on a server or node. The specific command to start MongoDB may vary depending on the platform and configuration.
3. Configuration: MongoDB instances are typically configured using a configuration file (e.g., `mongod.conf`) or command-line options. Configuration settings specify parameters such as the database storage location, network settings, security settings, and more.
4. Data Storage: Each MongoDB instance stores data in a specified data directory. Data files include collections, indexes, and system data files. MongoDB uses various file formats to store data efficiently.
5. Port and IP Address: MongoDB instances listen on a specific network port (default is 27017) and an IP address. Clients communicate with the MongoDB instance using this IP address and port.
6. Replica Sets: In a replica set configuration, multiple MongoDB instances work together to provide data redundancy and high availability. One instance is primary, and the others are secondaries. They replicate data from the primary and can take over if the primary fails.
7. Sharded Clusters: In a sharded cluster configuration, MongoDB instances are distributed across multiple servers or nodes. Each instance is responsible for a subset of the data (a shard). A query router (mongos) directs client requests to the appropriate shard.
8. Single-Instance Deployment: MongoDB can also be used in a standalone configuration, where a single instance runs on a server. This is common for development and testing environments.
9. Processes and Resources: Each MongoDB instance consumes system resources like CPU, memory, and disk space based on its configuration and workload. It manages database operations, indexes, query processing, and more.
10. Logging and Monitoring: MongoDB instances generate logs and can be monitored for performance and health. Monitoring tools and log files provide insights into the instance's operation.
11. Security: MongoDB instances can be secured with authentication, authorization, encryption, and other security features to protect data and control access.
12. Maintenance and Upgrades: MongoDB instances may require regular maintenance tasks, such as backups, updates, and configuration changes. Care should be taken to ensure data integrity during these operations.

MongoDB instances can be used in various configurations and scaled to meet the needs of different applications. Understanding how to manage and configure MongoDB instances is essential for database administrators and developers working with MongoDB databases.

   sudo systemctl start mongod
   ```
   This command starts the MongoDB service named "mongod."
2. Check the Service Status:
   To verify that MongoDB has started successfully, you can check the service status:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status mongod
   ```
   If MongoDB has started successfully, you should see "active (running)" in the output.
Stopping the MongoDB Service:
1. Stop MongoDB Service:
   To stop the MongoDB service, run:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop mongod
   ```
   This command stops the MongoDB service.
2. Check the Service Status:
   You can check the service status again to confirm that MongoDB has stopped:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status mongod
   ```
   If MongoDB has stopped, you should see "inactive (dead)" in the output.
Restarting the MongoDB Service:
If you want to restart the MongoDB service, you can use the `restart` command:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart mongod
```
Enabling MongoDB to Start on Boot:
By default, MongoDB will not start automatically when your system reboots. To enable MongoDB to start on boot, you can use the `enable` command:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable mongod
```
This command configures MongoDB to start automatically during system boot.
Disabling MongoDB from Starting on Boot:
To disable MongoDB from starting automatically on boot, you can use the `disable` command:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable mongod
```
This command removes the automatic start configuration.
Please note that the specific service name and commands may vary depending on your Linux distribution and how MongoDB was installed. Additionally, you may need to adjust permissions and configurations according to your system's requirements.

--------
Interacting with a MongoDB database through the MongoDB shell allows you to perform various database operations, including querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data. Below are some common MongoDB shell commands and operations:

Connecting to a MongoDB Server:
To start the MongoDB shell and connect to a MongoDB server, open your terminal and simply type `mongo`. By default, the shell connects to a MongoDB server running on `localhost` on port `27017`.
```bash
mongo
```
If your MongoDB server is running on a different host or port, you can specify the connection details:
```bash
mongo --host <hostname> --port <port>
```

Basic Database Operations:
1. Show Databases:
   To list all available databases, use the `show dbs` command:
   ```javascript
   show dbs
   ```
2. Switch to a Database:
   To switch to a specific database or create a new one, use the `use` command:
   ```javascript
   use mydb
   ```
   Replace `mydb` with the name of your desired database.
3. Insert Documents:
   You can insert documents into a collection using the `insertOne()` or `insertMany()` methods. For example:
   ```javascript
   db.myCollection.insertOne({ name: "John", age: 30 })
   ```
4. Query Documents:
   To query documents from a collection, use the `find()` method:
   ```javascript
   db.myCollection.find({ name: "John" })
   ```
5. Update Documents:
   To update documents, use the `updateOne()` or `updateMany()` methods:
   ```javascript
   db.myCollection.updateOne({ name: "John" }, { $set: { age: 31 } })
   ```
6. Delete Documents:
   To delete documents, use the `deleteOne()` or `deleteMany()` methods:
   ```javascript
   db.myCollection.deleteOne({ name: "John" })
   ```
7. Aggregation:
   You can perform aggregation operations using the `aggregate()` method to analyze data in various ways.
Additional Commands:
- `show collections`: Lists all collections in the current database.
- `db.dropDatabase()`: Deletes the current database.
- `db.myCollection.drop()`: Drops a specific collection.
- `db.createUser()`: Creates a new user with specific privileges.
- `db.runCommand()`: Executes various administrative commands.

Remember that the MongoDB shell is JavaScript-based, so you can also use JavaScript constructs and functions within your commands.
Make sure to refer to the MongoDB documentation for comprehensive information on shell commands and database operations: [MongoDB Shell Quick Reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongo-shell/)
Always exercise caution when performing database operations, especially in a production environment, and ensure that your MongoDB instance is properly secured.

To uninstall MongoDB on Ubuntu, you can use the following steps:

1. **Stop the MongoDB Service**:
   
   Before uninstalling MongoDB, stop the MongoDB service to ensure it's not running. You can do this with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop mongod
   ```

2. **Uninstall MongoDB Packages**:

   Ubuntu uses the `apt` package manager. To uninstall MongoDB and its associated packages, you can use the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get purge mongodb-org*
   ```

   This command will remove MongoDB and its related packages from your system.

3. **Remove Configuration Files**:

   To remove MongoDB configuration files, use the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -r /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-*.list
   ```

   This command removes the MongoDB repository configuration files.

4. **Remove Data and Log Directories**:

   You may also want to remove the MongoDB data and log directories if you don't plan to reinstall MongoDB. Be cautious, as this step will permanently delete your MongoDB data:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -r /var/lib/mongodb
   sudo rm -r /var/log/mongodb
   ```

5. **Clean Up**:

   After uninstalling MongoDB, you can also remove any MongoDB-related user and group that may have been created:

   ```bash
   sudo userdel mongodb
   sudo groupdel mongodb
   ```

6. **Optional**: If you plan to reinstall MongoDB or want to ensure all associated configuration and data are completely removed, you can also remove the MongoDB package cache:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get autoremove
   ```

That's it! MongoDB should now be uninstalled from your Ubuntu system. Make sure to double-check the commands and paths to ensure that you've removed all MongoDB-related components.

mongoDB connection using nodejs
Connecting to a MongoDB database using Node.js involves several steps, including setting up the MongoDB driver, establishing a connection, and performing database operations. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to connect to MongoDB using Node.js:
1. Install MongoDB Node.js Driver:
   First, you need to install the official MongoDB Node.js driver, `mongodb`, using npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install mongodb
   ```
2. Import the MongoDB Driver:
   In your Node.js application, you'll need to import the MongoDB driver to use it. Add the following line at the beginning of your JavaScript file:
   ```javascript
   const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
   ```
3. Set Up the MongoDB Connection String:
   You'll need to specify the connection details in a connection string. This string typically includes the server address, port, and database name. Replace the placeholders (`<username>`, `<password>`, `<server>`, `<port>`, and `<database>`) with your actual MongoDB credentials and configuration:
   ```javascript
   const uri = "mongodb://<username>:<password>@<server>:<port>/<database>";
   ```
   For example:
   ```javascript
   const uri = "mongodb://myusername:mypassword@localhost:27017/mydatabase";
   ```
4. Establish a Connection:
   Use the `MongoClient` to connect to the MongoDB server using the connection string you defined. You can wrap this in an asynchronous function:
   ```javascript
   async function connectToDatabase() {
     try {
       const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
       await client.connect();
       console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
       return client;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB:', error);
     }
   }
   const client = await connectToDatabase();
   ```
   This code establishes a connection to the MongoDB server and returns a `MongoClient` instance, which you can use to interact with the database.
5. Perform Database Operations:
   Once connected, you can use the `client` object to perform database operations. For example, to insert a document into a collection:
   ```javascript
   const db = client.db('<database_name>'); // Replace with your database name
   const collection = db.collection('<collection_name>'); // Replace with your collection name
   const document = { key: 'value' };
   const result = await collection.insertOne(document);
   console.log(`Inserted ${result.insertedCount} document(s)`);
   ```
6. Close the Connection:
   After you're done with your database operations, it's a good practice to close the connection to MongoDB:
   ```javascript
   await client.close();
   console.log('Connection to MongoDB closed');
   ```
   Closing the connection ensures that resources are properly released.

That's the basic process of connecting to a MongoDB database using Node.js. You can now perform various database operations, including querying, updating, and deleting data, based on your application's requirements.

CRUD operation - create, read, update, deleteConnecting to a MongoDB database using Node.js involves several steps, including setting up the MongoDB driver, establishing a connection, and performing database operations. 

----
cursors - 
reference to a result set returned by query
allow to retrieve data in manageable chunks or pages (pagination).

queries that return iterable objects and hold the full result set
a "cursor" is a pointer or reference to a result set returned by a query. Cursors are used to retrieve and navigate through large datasets that don't fit entirely in memory. Here's how cursors work and why they are important:
1. Query Execution:
   - When you execute a query in a database system, the server processes the query and generates a result set.
   - This result set may contain a large number of records or documents, especially in cases like data retrieval from a collection in MongoDB.
2. Pagination and Efficiency:
   - In many scenarios, it's not practical or efficient to retrieve the entire result set at once, especially if it's too large to fit in memory.
   - Cursors allow you to retrieve data in manageable chunks or pages, which is known as pagination.
3. Iterating Over Results:
   - Cursors enable you to iterate over the result set one document at a time or in batches, rather than loading everything into memory at once.
   - You fetch and process each document, and when you're done with one batch, you can request the next batch using the cursor.
4. Resource Management:
   - Cursors also help manage server and client resources efficiently. The server can release resources associated with a result set as you consume it, rather than keeping everything in memory until you're finished.
5. Example with MongoDB:
   - In MongoDB, when you execute a query, you get a cursor to the result set. You can use methods like `cursor.next()` or `cursor.toArray()` to retrieve documents one at a time or as an array of documents, respectively.
   - Cursors can be configured with options like batch size to control how many documents are retrieved in each batch.

Here's a simplified example of using a cursor in MongoDB with Node.js:
```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function queryAndIterate() {
  const uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb";
  const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

  try {
    await client.connect();
    const db = client.db('mydb');
    const collection = db.collection('mycollection');

    // Query for documents (this returns a cursor)
    const cursor = collection.find({ someField: 'someValue' });

    // Iterate over the cursor and process documents
    await cursor.forEach(document => {
      console.log(`Processing document: ${JSON.stringify(document)}`);
    });

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  } finally {
    // Close the cursor and the database connection
    client.close();
  }
}

queryAndIterate();
```

In this example, we connect to a MongoDB database, query for documents using `collection.find()`, and then use `cursor.forEach()` to iterate over the documents. This way, we efficiently handle large result sets without loading everything into memory at once.

---
queries
Mongoose is a popular Node.js library that provides an elegant and schema-based solution for working with MongoDB. When using Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database, you can perform various types of queries to retrieve, update, or delete data. Here are some common types of queries in Mongoose:
1. Find Query:
   - The `.find()` method is used to retrieve documents from a MongoDB collection that match specified conditions.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const User = require('./models/User'); // Import your Mongoose model
     User.find({ age: { $gte: 18 } }, (err, users) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log(users);
     });
     ```
2. Find One Query:
   - The `.findOne()` method retrieves the first document from a MongoDB collection that matches the specified conditions.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const User = require('./models/User'); // Import your Mongoose model
     User.findOne({ email: 'example@email.com' }, (err, user) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log(user);
     });
     ```
3. Create (Insert) Query:
   - You can use Mongoose models to create and insert new documents into a MongoDB collection.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const User = require('./models/User'); // Import your Mongoose model
     const newUser = new User({ name: 'John', age: 30 });
     newUser.save((err, user) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('User created:', user);
     });
     ```
4. Update Query:
   - Mongoose provides methods like `.updateOne()`, `.updateMany()`, and `.findByIdAndUpdate()` for updating documents in a collection.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const User = require('./models/User'); // Import your Mongoose model
     User.updateOne({ name: 'John' }, { age: 31 }, (err, result) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('Document updated:', result);
     });
     ```
5. Delete Query:
   - You can use methods like `.deleteOne()`, `.deleteMany()`, and `.findByIdAndDelete()` to remove documents from a collection.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const User = require('./models/User'); // Import your Mongoose model
     User.deleteOne({ name: 'John' }, (err) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('Document deleted');
     });
     ```
6. Aggregate Query:
   - The `.aggregate()` method allows you to perform aggregation operations on your data, such as grouping and calculating statistics.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const User = require('./models/User'); // Import your Mongoose model
     User.aggregate([
       { $group: { _id: '$age', count: { $sum: 1 } } },
       { $sort: { _id: 1 } },
     ], (err, results) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log(results);
     });
     ```
7. Populate Query (for Referenced Documents):
   - When working with related documents (using references), you can use `.populate()` to fetch and populate referenced fields.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const Post = require('./models/Post'); // Import your Mongoose model
     Post.find().populate('author').exec((err, posts) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log(posts);
     });
     ```

These are some common types of queries you can perform using Mongoose when working with MongoDB. To use these queries, you'll need to create Mongoose models that define the schema for your data and then import and use those models in your application.

---
journaling
changes are first recorded (in journal files) and then applied to data files
Journaling in MongoDB is a feature that provides durability guarantees for write operations, ensuring that data is not lost in the event of a system crash or power failure. MongoDB uses a write-ahead log (WAL) for journaling, which records changes before they are applied to the data files. Here's an explanation of journaling in MongoDB:
1. Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):
   - MongoDB's journaling system is based on the principle of write-ahead logging (WAL). This means that before any data is modified in the database's data files, the change is first written to a journal file.
2. Durability:
   - Journaling provides durability guarantees, which means that once a write operation is acknowledged as written to the journal, it is considered durable and won't be lost even if the system crashes.
   - This ensures that MongoDB can recover data to a consistent state in the event of unexpected shutdowns or failures.
3. Journal Files:
   - Journal files in MongoDB are stored in a subdirectory named `journal` within the MongoDB data directory.
   - Journal files have a fixed size and are rolled over as they fill up. Old journal files are eventually removed.
4. Write Concern:
   - You can control the level of write concern when performing write operations in MongoDB. Write concern options determine how many acknowledgments are required for a write operation to be considered successful.
   - Using a write concern of "w:1" ensures that data is written to the journal, while "w:0" does not wait for journaling and is faster but less durable.
5. Performance Impact:
   - Enabling journaling does introduce some performance overhead because every write operation must be logged to the journal. However, the durability benefits often outweigh the performance cost, especially for mission-critical applications.
6. Configuration:
   - Journaling is enabled by default in MongoDB, and you can configure journaling options in the MongoDB configuration file (e.g., `mongod.conf`).
   - You can control the journal file size, specify the directory for journal files, and configure other related settings.

Here's an example of configuring journaling in the MongoDB configuration file:
```yaml
# MongoDB configuration file (mongod.conf)

storage:
  journal:
    enabled: true   # Enable journaling
    directory: /var/lib/mongodb/journal  # Directory for journal files
    commitIntervalMs: 100  # Time interval for writing journal entries
```

Journaling in MongoDB is a crucial feature for data integrity and durability, making it suitable for applications where data consistency and reliability are essential, such as financial systems, healthcare applications, and other mission-critical scenarios.

----
bulk insertion
Bulk insertion in MongoDB allows you to efficiently insert multiple documents into a collection in a single operation. This is more efficient than inserting documents one by one, especially when dealing with large datasets. MongoDB provides methods for performing bulk insertions. Here's how you can do it using the official MongoDB Node.js driver:
Assuming you have a Node.js application with MongoDB and you've set up a connection to the database, you can use the `insertMany()` method to perform bulk insertions. Here's a step-by-step guide:
1. Import the MongoDB driver:
   Import the MongoDB driver in your Node.js application:
   ```javascript
   const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
   ```
2. Establish a connection to the MongoDB server:
   Connect to your MongoDB server or cluster. You can create a MongoClient instance and connect to the database using a connection string:
   ```javascript
   const uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb";
   const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

   // Connect to the MongoDB server
   client.connect().then(() => {
     console.log("Connected to MongoDB");
     // Insert data here
   }).catch(err => {
     console.error("Error connecting to MongoDB:", err);
   });
   ```
3. Define the documents to insert:
   Create an array of documents that you want to insert into your MongoDB collection:
   ```javascript
   const documentsToInsert = [
     { name: "Document 1", value: 100 },
     { name: "Document 2", value: 200 },
     // Add more documents as needed
   ];
   ```
4. Perform the bulk insertion:
   Use the `insertMany()` method to insert the array of documents into the collection:
   ```javascript
   const db = client.db('mydb'); // Replace with your database name
   const collection = db.collection('mycollection'); // Replace with your collection name

   collection.insertMany(documentsToInsert, (err, result) => {
     if (err) {
       console.error("Error inserting documents:", err);
     } else {
       console.log(`${result.insertedCount} documents inserted`);
     }
     client.close(); // Close the MongoDB connection when done
   });
   ```
5. Close the MongoDB connection:
   After the bulk insertion is completed, make sure to close the MongoDB connection to release resources:
   ```javascript
   client.close();
   ```
By using `insertMany()`, you can efficiently insert multiple documents into your MongoDB collection in a single operation, reducing the overhead of multiple insert operations and improving the overall performance of your application.

----
mongoose
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a structured and schema-based way to interact with MongoDB databases using JavaScript. Mongoose simplifies database operations, enforces data validation, and offers powerful features for working with MongoDB. Here's an overview of key features and how to use Mongoose:
Key Features of Mongoose:
1. Schema Definition: Mongoose allows you to define schemas for your data models. Schemas define the structure and constraints of your data, including the types of fields, default values, and validation rules.
2. Model Creation: You can create models based on your defined schemas. Models represent collections in MongoDB and provide an interface for querying and manipulating data.
3. Connection Management: Mongoose helps you establish and manage connections to MongoDB databases. It supports connecting to multiple databases in a single application.
4. CRUD Operations: Mongoose provides methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your data models. For example, you can create, read, update, and delete documents in a MongoDB collection using Mongoose methods.
5. Validation: Mongoose offers built-in validation for data before it is saved to the database. You can specify validation rules for each field in your schema.
6. Middleware: Middleware functions can be added to perform tasks before or after certain database operations. This can include tasks like data transformation, logging, or authentication.
7. Query Building: Mongoose provides a fluent API for building complex queries. You can chain methods to create and execute queries with various conditions, sorting, and pagination.
8. Population: Mongoose supports population, which allows you to retrieve documents from referenced collections when querying. This is useful for working with related data.
9. Hooks and Events: You can define pre-save and post-save hooks, as well as other events, to execute custom logic when working with documents.

Using Mongoose in Node.js:
Here's a basic example of how to use Mongoose in a Node.js application:
1. Installation: First, install Mongoose using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install mongoose
   ```
2. Setting up a Connection: Create a connection to your MongoDB server:
   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mydb', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
   ```
3. Defining a Schema and Model: Define a schema for your data and create a model based on the schema:
   ```javascript
   const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

   const userSchema = new Schema({
     username: String,
     email: String,
     age: Number
   });

   const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
   ```
4. CRUD Operations: Use the `User` model to perform CRUD operations:
   - Creating a new user:
     ```javascript
     const newUser = new User({
       username: 'john_doe',
       email: 'john@example.com',
       age: 30
     });

     newUser.save((err, user) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('User saved:', user);
     });
     ```
   - Querying users:
     ```javascript
     User.find({ age: { $gte: 18 } }, (err, users) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('Users:', users);
     });
     ```
   - Updating a user:
     ```javascript
     User.updateOne({ username: 'john_doe' }, { age: 31 }, (err, result) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('User updated:', result);
     });
     ```
   - Deleting a user:
     ```javascript
     User.deleteOne({ username: 'john_doe' }, (err) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('User deleted');
     });
     ```

This is a simplified example of how to use Mongoose. In real-world applications, you would typically define more complex schemas, handle error handling and validation, and structure your code in a modular way. Mongoose provides powerful tools for building robust MongoDB-driven applications in Node.js.

----
object mapping via mongoose
abstracting mongoDB document in js object
Object Mapping (often referred to as ODM, Object-Document Mapping) via Mongoose is a way to define and work with data models in a MongoDB database using JavaScript objects. Mongoose simplifies the interaction with MongoDB by providing an abstraction layer that allows you to work with data as if it were native JavaScript objects. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform object mapping with Mongoose:
1. Installation:
   First, install Mongoose in your Node.js project:
   ```bash
   npm install mongoose
   ```
2. Setting Up a Connection:
   Create a connection to your MongoDB database using Mongoose. Typically, this is done in your application's entry point (e.g., `app.js` or `index.js`).
   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mydb', {
     useNewUrlParser: true,
     useUnifiedTopology: true,
   });

   const db = mongoose.connection;

   db.on('error', (err) => {
     console.error('MongoDB connection error:', err);
   });

   db.once('open', () => {
     console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
   });
   ```
3. Defining a Schema:
   Define a schema for your data. A schema specifies the structure of documents in a collection, including the fields, their types, and any validation rules.
   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     username: { type: String, required: true },
     email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
     age: { type: Number, min: 18 },
   });

   const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

   module.exports = User;
   ```
4. Creating and Saving Documents:
   You can create instances of your Mongoose model and save them to the database.
   ```javascript
   const User = require('./models/User'); // Import your User model

   const newUser = new User({
     username: 'john_doe',
     email: 'john@example.com',
     age: 30,
   });

   newUser.save((err, user) => {
     if (err) {
       console.error('Error saving user:', err);
     } else {
       console.log('User saved:', user);
     }
   });
   ```
5. Querying Documents:
   You can use the model to query documents in the collection.

   ```javascript
   User.find({ age: { $gte: 18 } }, (err, users) => {
     if (err) {
       console.error('Error querying users:', err);
     } else {
       console.log('Users:', users);
     }
   });
   ```
6. Updating Documents:
   You can use Mongoose's update methods to modify documents.
   ```javascript
   User.updateOne({ username: 'john_doe' }, { age: 31 }, (err, result) => {
     if (err) {
       console.error('Error updating user:', err);
     } else {
       console.log('User updated:', result);
     }
   });
   ```
7. Deleting Documents:
   Mongoose provides methods to delete documents as well.
   ```javascript
   User.deleteOne({ username: 'john_doe' }, (err) => {
     if (err) {
       console.error('Error deleting user:', err);
     } else {
       console.log('User deleted');
     }
   });
   ```

Mongoose simplifies the process of working with MongoDB by allowing you to interact with your data models using native JavaScript objects and methods. It also provides features for data validation, middleware, and more to help you build robust and maintainable applications.

Creating models in Mongoose is a fundamental step in defining the structure and behavior of your data in MongoDB collections. A model in Mongoose corresponds to a collection in MongoDB and provides an interface for creating, querying, updating, and deleting documents in that collection. Here's how to create models in Mongoose:
1. Import Mongoose:
   Start by importing the Mongoose library in your Node.js application:

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   ```
2. Define a Schema:
   A schema defines the structure of documents in a collection, including the fields, their types, and any additional options such as validation rules, default values, and indexes. Define a schema using the `mongoose.Schema` class.
   ```javascript
   const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

   const userSchema = new Schema({
     username: String,
     email: String,
     age: Number,
     created_at: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
   });
   ```
   In this example, we've defined a `userSchema` with fields for `username`, `email`, `age`, and a `created_at` timestamp field.
3. Create a Model:
   Once you have defined the schema, you can create a model based on that schema using the `mongoose.model` method. The model represents a MongoDB collection.
   ```javascript
   const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
   ```
   The first argument to `mongoose.model` is the name of the model, and the second argument is the schema to use for documents in the collection.
4. Export the Model:
   It's a good practice to export the model so that you can use it in other parts of your application.
   ```javascript
   module.exports = User;
   ```
   This allows you to import the `User` model in other files where you need to interact with the MongoDB collection.
Putting it all together, here's a complete example:
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Define a schema
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
const userSchema = new Schema({
  username: String,
  email: String,
  age: Number,
  created_at: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});

// Create a model
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

// Export the model
module.exports = User;
```

With this setup, you can now use the `User` model to perform CRUD operations on the "users" collection in MongoDB. For example, you can create new users, query for existing users, update user information, and delete users using the `User` model's methods.
