Certainly! Let's go through the various Promise methods with examples and explanations:
1. **Creating a Promise:**
   The Promise constructor is used to create a new promise. It takes an executor function with `resolve` and `reject` functions as parameters.
   ```javascript
   const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     if (/* some condition */) {
       resolve("Promise resolved");
     } else {
       reject("Promise rejected");
     }
   });
   ```
2. **`then(onFulfilled, onRejected)`:**
   The `then` method is used to specify callbacks to be executed when the promise is resolved (fulfilled) or rejected.
   ```javascript
   myPromise.then(
     (value) => {
       console.log("Fulfilled:", value);
     },
     (reason) => {
       console.log("Rejected:", reason);
     }
   );
   ```
3. **`catch(onRejected)`:**
   The `catch` method is a shorthand for handling only the rejection of the promise.
   ```javascript
   myPromise.catch((reason) => {
     console.log("Rejected:", reason);
   });
   ```
4. **`finally(onFinally)`:**
   The `finally` method is used for specifying a callback that will be executed regardless of whether the promise is resolved or rejected.
   ```javascript
   myPromise.finally(() => {
     console.log("Promise is settled.");
   });
   ```
5. **`Promise.resolve(value)`:**
   `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise with the specified value.
   ```javascript
   const resolvedPromise = Promise.resolve("Resolved value");
   ```
6. **`Promise.reject(reason)`:**
   `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise with the specified reason.
   ```javascript
   const rejectedPromise = Promise.reject("Rejection reason");
   ```
7. **`Promise.all(iterable)`:**
   `Promise.all` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of results when all promises in the iterable are resolved.
   ```javascript
   const promise1 = Promise.resolve("One");
   const promise2 = Promise.resolve("Two");
   Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then((values) => {
     console.log("All promises resolved:", values);
   });
   ```
8. **`Promise.race(iterable)`:**
   `Promise.race` returns a promise that is resolved or rejected as soon as one of the promises in the iterable is resolved or rejected.
   ```javascript
   const fastPromise = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, "Fast"));
   const slowPromise = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, "Slow"));

   Promise.race([fastPromise, slowPromise]).then((value) => {
     console.log("First promise resolved:", value);
   });
   ```
9. **`Promise.allSettled(iterable)`:**
   `Promise.allSettled` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of result objects when all promises in the iterable have settled.
   ```javascript
   const promise1 = Promise.resolve("Success");
   const promise2 = Promise.reject("Failure");

   Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2]).then((results) => {
     console.log("Results:", results);
   });
   ```
10. **`Promise.any(iterable)`:**
    `Promise.any` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the first fulfilled promise in the iterable.
    ```javascript
    const promise1 = Promise.reject("First rejection");
    const promise2 = Promise.resolve("Second success");

    Promise.any([promise1, promise2]).then((value) => {
      console.log("First fulfilled promise:", value);
    });
    ```
11. **`Promise.raceSettled(iterable)`:**
    `Promise.raceSettled` returns a promise that is resolved with the result object of the first promise in the iterable to settle.
    ```javascript
    const promise1 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, "Slow"));
    const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, "Fast"));

    Promise.raceSettled([promise1, promise2]).then((result) => {
      console.log("First promise to settle:", result);
    });
    ```
These examples illustrate the use of various Promise methods for creating, handling, and managing asynchronous operations. Promises are a fundamental part of JavaScript for dealing with asynchronous code and ensuring that operations are performed in a predictable manner.
