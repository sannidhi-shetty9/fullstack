/*
In Node.js, the `http.request()` method is used to send an HTTP request to a remote server and receive an HTTP response. It allows you to make HTTP requests to web servers or APIs from your Node.js application. You can use this method to perform various types of HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more.

Here's the basic syntax for `http.request()`:
*/
const http = require('http');

const options = {
  hostname: 'localhost', // The hostname or IP address of the server
  port: 3000, // The port of the server (80 for HTTP)
  path: '/api/resource', // The path or endpoint you want to request
  method: 'GET', // The HTTP method (e.g., 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE')
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json', // Optional request headers
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN', // Optional authorization header
  },
};

const req = http.request(options, (res) => {
  // Callback function for handling the response
  let responseData = '';

  res.on('data', (chunk) => {
    // Handle incoming data chunks
    responseData += chunk;
  });

  res.on('end', () => {
    // All data has been received
    console.log('Response:', responseData);
  });
});

req.on('error', (error) => {
  // Handle errors that may occur during the request
  console.error('Error:', error);
});

// If sending data in the request body (e.g., for POST requests):
// req.write('request data here');

// End the request to send it
req.end();

/*
In the code above:
1. We require the `http` module to use the `http.request()` method.
2. We define an `options` object that specifies the details of the HTTP request, such as the hostname, port, path, method, and headers. You can customize these options based on your specific use case.
3. We create an HTTP request using `http.request(options, callback)`, where `callback` is a function that handles the response from the server.
4. Inside the response callback, we listen for `'data'` events to receive data chunks as they arrive, and we concatenate them into the `responseData` variable. The `'end'` event signals that all data has been received, and we can then process the response.
5. We also listen for `'error'` events to handle any errors that may occur during the request.
6. If you need to send data in the request body (e.g., for POST requests), you can use the `req.write()` method to write the data to the request.
7. Finally, we end the request with `req.end()` to actually send the request to the server.

You can adapt this code for different HTTP methods and customize the request headers and data payload as needed for your specific use case.
