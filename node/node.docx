node js: server side js run time environment
NPM: it is a command line tool and online repository containing js modules and packages (that can be installed and used in node js applications), used for managing node js applications or projects.
package.json: is a json file containing the metadata including the dependencies, scripts and configuration of a js project.
modules: encapsulated unit of code (Modules in Node.js are individual JavaScript files that encapsulate specific functionality or code)
packages: dir containing package.json file. It can also include JavaScript files and other resources required for the package to function.

------
Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used in Google Chrome. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it well-suited for building scalable and high-performance network applications.

Key features and concepts of Node.js include:

1. Event-Driven Architecture: Node.js uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations, such as reading and writing to files, making network requests, and responding to client requests. This event-driven architecture allows Node.js to handle many connections simultaneously without blocking the execution of code.
2. Non-Blocking I/O: Node.js uses non-blocking, or asynchronous, I/O operations, which means that it can perform multiple I/O operations concurrently without waiting for one to complete before starting another. This is essential for building efficient and responsive applications.
3. NPM (Node Package Manager): NPM is the default package manager for Node.js, and it provides a vast ecosystem of reusable packages and libraries that can be easily installed and integrated into Node.js applications. NPM is also used for managing project dependencies.
4. Modules: Node.js allows developers to create modular code using CommonJS modules. This enables code organization and reusability, as well as facilitating the use of third-party packages.
5. Single-Threaded: Node.js itself runs in a single thread, but it can leverage multiple threads through worker processes and libraries like the "cluster" module to handle concurrency. However, developers still need to be cautious about CPU-bound tasks that may block the event loop.
6. Cross-Platform: Node.js is cross-platform, meaning it can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
7. HTTP Server: Node.js can be used to create web servers, making it popular for building web applications and APIs. The "http" module is often used to create server-side applications.
8. Real-time Applications: Node.js is well-suited for building real-time applications like chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative tools, thanks to its event-driven, low-latency architecture.
9. Community and Ecosystem: Node.js has a large and active developer community, which contributes to its extensive ecosystem of packages and tools.
To get started with Node.js, you need to install it on your computer. You can download the installer from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/) or use a version manager like NVM (Node Version Manager) to manage different Node.js versions.

Once installed, you can create Node.js applications by writing JavaScript code and utilizing the various built-in modules and third-party packages available through NPM. Node.js is versatile and can be used for a wide range of applications, including web servers, command-line tools, and more.


-------------
NPM, which stands for Node Package Manager, is the default package manager for Node.js. It is a command-line tool and an online repository of open-source Node.js packages and modules that can be easily installed and used in Node.js applications. NPM serves as a central hub for the JavaScript community, allowing developers to share and distribute their code, making it a critical component of the Node.js ecosystem.

Here are some key aspects and functionalities of NPM:

1. Package Management: NPM simplifies the process of managing external libraries and dependencies in Node.js applications. It allows developers to specify which packages their project depends on in a file called `package.json`. These dependencies can include libraries, frameworks, and other Node.js modules.
2. Installation: You can use NPM to install packages and modules from the NPM registry by running the `npm install` command. NPM will automatically download the specified packages and their dependencies and store them in the `node_modules` directory of your project.
3. Dependency Resolution: NPM is responsible for resolving and managing package dependencies, ensuring that the correct versions of packages are installed to avoid compatibility issues.
4. Version Management: NPM allows you to specify version ranges for your project's dependencies. This enables you to control which versions of packages are installed and to receive updates when new versions are available.
5. Scripts: The `package.json` file can also contain scripts that define various tasks and commands for your project, such as building, testing, or running the application. You can run these scripts using the `npm run` command.
6. Global Packages: NPM allows you to install packages globally, making them accessible from the command line. Global packages are typically command-line tools or utilities that you want to use across multiple projects.
7. Publishing Packages: If you're a package author, NPM provides a straightforward way to publish your own packages to the NPM registry. This makes it easy for other developers to discover and use your code.
8. Security Scanning: NPM includes built-in security features that scan packages for known vulnerabilities and provide warnings or recommendations when installing packages with security issues.
9. Private Packages: NPM supports both public and private packages. You can publish private packages to the NPM registry for use within your organization or for select collaborators.
10. Versioning and Semver: NPM follows semantic versioning (Semver) conventions, which helps developers understand the compatibility and impact of package updates.

NPM is a fundamental tool for Node.js development, and it has a vast and active ecosystem with thousands of packages available for various use cases. It's an essential part of building Node.js applications, as it streamlines the process of integrating external code and libraries into your projects, simplifies version management, and promotes code reuse across the Node.js community


npm install package-name
This command will download and install the package and its dependencies into your project's node_modules directory. It will also add an entry to your project's package.json file under the "dependencies" section.

to use the package, var obj = require('package-name')

script: task that can be run in command line
----------
The `package.json` file is a crucial part of Node.js and JavaScript projects. It is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file that contains metadata about a project, including its dependencies, scripts, and various configuration settings. `package.json` serves as the project's manifest or configuration file, and it's commonly used in Node.js applications and libraries. Here are the key components typically found in a `package.json` file:

1. `name`: This field specifies the name of the project or package. It should be unique within the NPM registry and follow naming conventions. The name is a string and must be lowercase and contain no spaces.
2. `version`: The version field indicates the current version of the project or package. It follows semantic versioning (Semver) conventions, with three numeric segments (e.g., `"1.2.3"`), where each segment signifies a different level of changes (major, minor, patch).
3. `description`: This field provides a brief description of the project, helping users understand its purpose and functionality.
4. `main`: The main field specifies the entry point of the application or library. For libraries, this typically points to the main module that will be imported when the package is used. For applications, it often points to the main JavaScript file that should be executed when running the program.
5. `scripts`: The scripts field defines a set of custom scripts or commands that can be executed with the `npm run` command. Common script names include "start," "test," "build," and others. You can specify commands to run during development, testing, building, and more.
6. `dependencies`: This field lists the project's runtime dependencies, which are packages required for the project to function correctly. Dependencies are specified as key-value pairs, where the key is the package name, and the value is the version range required. When someone installs the project, NPM will automatically download and install these dependencies.
7. `devDependencies`: Similar to `dependencies`, the `devDependencies` field lists packages that are only needed during development, such as testing frameworks, build tools, or linters. These packages are not required for the project's runtime and are typically not included when the project is deployed.
8. `peerDependencies`: This field specifies packages that the project expects its consumers (other packages or applications) to provide. Peer dependencies help ensure compatibility between packages.
9. `keywords`: An array of keywords or tags that describe the project, making it easier for users to discover related packages in the NPM registry.
10. `author`: The name of the project's author or maintainer.
11. `license`: The license under which the project is distributed. Common licenses include MIT, Apache 2.0, and GPL. It's important to specify the license to inform users of the project's licensing terms.
12. `repository`: The URL or information about the version control repository where the project's source code is hosted. This field can be used for linking to the project's source code and facilitating collaboration.
13. `bugs` and `homepage`: These fields can provide URLs for the project's issue tracker and homepage, respectively.

Here's a simple example of a `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "my-node-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Node.js application",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "mocha"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "mocha": "^9.0.3"
  },
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

The `package.json` file is essential for managing project dependencies, running scripts, documenting project details, and ensuring consistent behavior across different development environments. Developers often create or modify this file when initiating a new project or adding dependencies and scripts to an existing one.

--
pre and post hooks-
when we execute npm run <command> , npm will do the following-
npm run pre<command>
npm run <command>
npm run post<command>

eg: 
"scripts":
{
  "lint": "task 1",
  "prelint: "task2",
  "postlint": "task3",
}

npm run lint -> executes tasks in order: task1 -> task2 -> task3

we can pass arguments to the script using -- operator
eg: npm run cmd --arg -> would pass arg argument to cmd

npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm (Node Package Manager) and is available by default when you install Node.js. It is used to execute binaries from packages that aren't globally installed on your system. This is particularly useful when you want to run a command from a package without having to install it globally or add it to your project's dependencies.

Executing Local Packages: You can use npx to run executables from packages installed in your local node_modules directory. For example, if you have a package named my-package installed locally, you can run its executable like this:

npx my-package-command

---------
In Node.js, packages and modules are fundamental concepts that help organize and structure your code. They facilitate code reuse, maintainability, and modularity, making it easier to build complex applications. Let's explore both packages and modules in Node.js:

1. Packages:
A package in Node.js is a directory that contains a `package.json` file, which serves as the package's metadata and configuration. It can also include JavaScript files and other resources required for the package to function. Packages are typically published on the NPM (Node Package Manager) registry, which allows developers to share their code with others.
Key points about packages:
- Packages are often libraries or modules that provide specific functionality that can be reused across different projects.
- To use a package in your Node.js project, you can add it as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file using NPM. For example:
  
  ```json
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
  ```
  
  Then, you can run `npm install` to fetch and install the specified package.
- Node.js itself is distributed as a package, so when you install Node.js, you are technically installing a package from the NPM registry.

2. Modules:
is encapsulated unit of code
Modules in Node.js are individual JavaScript files that encapsulate specific functionality or code. They are designed to keep code organized and to prevent the pollution of the global namespace. Node.js follows the CommonJS module system for managing modules.
Key points about modules:
- In Node.js, each file is treated as a separate module. You can create your own modules by defining functions, variables, or objects within a JavaScript file.
- To make the functionality of a module available for use in other parts of your application, you can use the `module.exports` or `exports` object to export specific functions, objects, or values.
  For example, in a `math.js` module:
  
  ```javascript
  // math.js
  function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  
  module.exports = {
    add: add
  };
  ```
  You can then import and use this module in another file like this:

  ```javascript
  const math = require('./math.js');
  
  console.log(math.add(3, 4)); // Outputs: 7
  ```

- Node.js provides a number of built-in modules like `fs` (File System), `http` (HTTP), and `path` (Path handling) that you can use to perform various tasks without needing to install external packages.
- Modules can also be installed from the NPM registry and used in your project as external dependencies. For example, the `express` package is a module that provides web application functionality.

Packages and modules are essential building blocks in Node.js development. They allow developers to create maintainable, reusable, and scalable codebases by breaking down applications into smaller, manageable pieces of code. By using packages and modules effectively, you can build complex applications while keeping your codebase organized and efficient.

When you install a package globally using `npm install -g <package-name>`, the package is saved to a global directory on your system, separate from your project's directory structure. This global directory contains globally installed packages that provide command-line tools or utilities that you can access from any command prompt or terminal window.

Here's how the process works:
1. Global Installation: When you run `npm install -g <package-name>`, NPM will download the specified package and its dependencies (if any) from the NPM registry. Instead of saving them in your project's `node_modules` directory, it installs them in a global directory that is specific to your Node.js installation.
2. Global Directory: The global directory where globally installed packages are stored depends on your system and Node.js installation. Common locations include `/usr/local/lib/node_modules` on Linux and macOS systems and `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules` on Windows.
3. Executable Binaries: Many packages installed globally provide command-line utilities or binaries that can be executed directly from your terminal or command prompt. These binaries are typically installed in a directory within the global installation directory that is included in your system's PATH environment variable. This allows you to run these tools from any location in your file system.
4. Global vs. Local Packages: It's important to understand the distinction between global and local packages. Local packages are installed in your project's directory and are typically listed in your project's `package.json` file under `"dependencies"` or `"devDependencies"`. Global packages are not specific to any project and can be used across multiple projects on your system.
5. Security Considerations: Installing packages globally can introduce security and versioning issues. If different projects depend on different versions of the same globally installed package, conflicts may arise. This is one of the reasons why it's recommended to use local (project-specific) dependencies whenever possible.
6. Updating Global Packages: To update a globally installed package, you can use the `-g` flag with the `npm install` command followed by the package name and the `@latest` tag. For example:
   ```bash
   npm install -g <package-name>@latest
   ```
   This will update the package to the latest version available on the NPM registry.
7. Uninstalling Global Packages: To uninstall a globally installed package, you can use the `-g` flag with the `npm uninstall` command followed by the package name. For example:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g <package-name>
   ```
In summary, globally installed packages in Node.js are stored in a system-wide directory and provide command-line utilities that can be used across different projects. However, it's important to use global packages judiciously and prefer local (project-specific) dependencies whenever possible to avoid conflicts and maintain project isolation.




-------------
Initializing NPM (Node Package Manager) in a directory by running the `npm init` command serves several important purposes in a Node.js project:
1. Creates a `package.json` File: The primary purpose of running `npm init` is to generate a `package.json` file in the current directory. The `package.json` file is a crucial part of Node.js projects, as it contains metadata about the project, its dependencies, scripts, and other configuration details. It serves as a project manifest and is used for package management and project configuration.
2. Configures Project Metadata: During the initialization process, `npm init` prompts you to provide various pieces of information about your project, including its name, version, description, entry point, test command, repository URL, author, and license. This metadata helps document your project and make it discoverable by others.
3. Manages Project Dependencies: If you plan to use external Node.js packages or libraries in your project, you can specify them as dependencies during the initialization process. These dependencies are recorded in the `package.json` file, allowing you to easily install and manage them using NPM.
4. Defines Project Scripts: The `package.json` file includes a section for defining scripts that can be executed using the `npm run` command. This is useful for automating common tasks such as running tests, building the project, or starting a development server. You can configure these scripts during initialization.
5. Sets Defaults: `npm init` sets default values for various fields in the `package.json` file, such as the version (usually starting at 1.0.0) and the main entry point (usually `index.js`). You can modify these defaults to match your project's requirements.
6. Facilitates Project Management: With a `package.json` file in place, you can easily manage project dependencies, version control, and build processes. It simplifies collaboration with other developers by providing a standardized project structure and clear documentation.
Here's how to initialize NPM and create a `package.json` file:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Node.js project.
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm init
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to provide information about your project, including its name, version, description, entry point, and more. You can press Enter to accept the default values or provide custom values.
5. Once you've completed the prompts, `npm init` will generate a `package.json` file based on the information you provided.
6. You can review and edit the generated `package.json` file as needed to add dependencies, scripts, and other project-specific details.

Initializing NPM and creating a `package.json` file is typically one of the first steps in setting up a Node.js project, as it establishes the project's configuration and provides a foundation for package management and project organization.


-------------
In Node.js, the `module.exports` object is a special object that is used to define what a module exports as its public interface. It determines which functions, objects, or values are accessible to other modules that require the module using the `require` function. Essentially, `module.exports` allows you to share functionality and data between different parts of your Node.js application.

Here's how `module.exports` works and what it does:
1. Exporting from a Module:
   When you create a module in Node.js, you can define what you want to export by assigning it to the `module.exports` object. This can be any JavaScript value, including functions, objects, variables, or primitive values.
   For example, in a module named `my-module.js`, you can export a function like this:
   ```javascript
   // my-module.js
   module.exports = function() {
     console.log('Hello from my-module!');
   };
   ```
   In this case, the module exports an anonymous function.
2. Importing in Another Module:
   To use the functionality or data from a module in another module, you can use the `require` function to import the module. The value assigned to `module.exports` in the imported module will be accessible in the importing module.
   For example, in another module, you can import and use the function exported from `my-module.js` like this:
   ```javascript
   const myFunction = require('./my-module.js');
   myFunction(); // Outputs: Hello from my-module!
   ```
   The `myFunction` variable now holds a reference to the function that was exported from `my-module.js`.
3. Custom Exports:
   `module.exports` is a flexible mechanism. You can export multiple values or functions by assigning an object with properties to it:
   ```javascript
   // my-module.js
   module.exports = {
     greet: function() {
       console.log('Hello from my-module!');
     },
     add: function(a, b) {
       return a + b;
     }
   };
   ```
   In the importing module, you can access the exported functions as properties of the imported object:
   ```javascript
   const myModule = require('./my-module.js');
   myModule.greet(); // Outputs: Hello from my-module!
   const result = myModule.add(3, 4);
   console.log(result); // Outputs: 7
   ```
4. Default Exports:
   In addition to assigning values to `module.exports`, you can also use ES6-style default exports by directly assigning a value to `module.exports`. This allows you to import the default export without using curly braces.
   For example:
   ```javascript
   // my-module.js
   module.exports = function() {
     console.log('Hello from my-module!');
   };
   ```
   In the importing module:
   ```javascript
   const myModule = require('./my-module.js');
   myModule(); // Outputs: Hello from my-module!
   ```
In summary, `module.exports` is a crucial mechanism in Node.js that allows you to expose functions, objects, and data from one module so that they can be used in other modules. It's a fundamental building block for creating modular and reusable code in Node.js applications.


--------------
In Node.js, the `require` function returns the `exports` object of the required module. This object contains the properties and values that have been assigned to `module.exports` or `exports` within the required module. The returned `exports` object can be used to access the functionality exposed by the module.
Here's how it works:
1. Exporting from a Module:
   In a module (JavaScript file), you define the functionality you want to export. You typically use the `module.exports` or `exports` object to do this. For example:
   ```javascript
   // my-module.js
   exports.sayHello = function() {
     console.log('Hello, world!');
   };
  ```
   In this module, the `sayHello` function is added as a property of the `exports` object.
2. Using `require`:
   When you use `require` to import the module in another JavaScript file, it returns the `exports` object of the module:
   ```javascript
   const myModule = require('./my-module.js');
   ```
   Now, `myModule` is an object that contains the properties and methods defined in the `my-module.js` module.
3. Accessing Exported Functionality:
   You can access the exported functionality through the `myModule` object:
   ```javascript
   myModule.sayHello(); // Outputs: Hello, world!
  ```

   In this example, we're calling the `sayHello` function, which was exported from the `my-module.js` module.
It's important to note that the `require` function in Node.js performs caching. When you require the same module in multiple places within your application, Node.js caches the module after the first require operation. Subsequent require calls for the same module return the cached module, which can improve performance.
Additionally, if you only want to import a specific property or function from a module, you can destructure it during the require operation. For example:
```javascript
const { sayHello } = require('./my-module.js');
sayHello(); // Outputs: Hello, world!
```
In this case, we're only importing the `sayHello` function from the `my-module.js` module.


-------
In Node.js, module loading is the process of importing and using modules in your JavaScript code. Node.js uses a module system known as CommonJS, which provides a way to organize and structure your code into reusable modules. This system allows you to load and use modules from other files, making it easier to manage and maintain your Node.js applications.
Here's how module loading works in Node.js:
1. Creating Modules:
   You can create modules by defining your functionality in separate JavaScript files. Each file is treated as a module, and you can export specific functions, objects, or values from that module to make them accessible to other parts of your application.
   For example, you can create a module in a file named `math.js`:
   ```javascript
   // math.js
   exports.add = function(a, b) {
     return a + b;
   };
   ```
   In this module, the `add` function is exported and can be used in other modules.
2. Using the `require` Function:
   To use a module in another part of your application, you use the `require` function. The `require` function takes the path to the module you want to load and returns the exported functionality from that module.
   For example, in another file, you can use `require` to import the `math.js` module:
   ```javascript
   const math = require('./math.js');
   ```
   The `math` variable now contains the exported functionality from the `math.js` module.
3. Accessing Exported Functionality:
   You can access the exported functionality from the imported module using the variables or properties you defined in the module. For example:

   ```javascript
   const sum = math.add(3, 4); // Calls the add function from the math module
   console.log(sum); // Outputs: 7
   ```
4. Core Modules:
   Node.js includes a set of core modules that are available for use without requiring external files. You can load and use core modules in your application using the `require` function as well. For example:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs'); // Loading the File System core module
   ```
   Core modules are typically loaded using module names without file paths.
5. Relative and Absolute Paths:
   When using `require`, you can specify module paths using relative or absolute paths. Relative paths start with `./` or `../` and refer to files relative to the current file. Absolute paths refer to files using the full file system path.
   ```javascript
   const myModule = require('./my-module.js'); // Relative path
   const math = require('/path/to/math.js'); // Absolute path
   ```
6. Caching:
   Node.js caches the loaded modules to improve performance. When you `require` a module multiple times within your application, it won't be reloaded from disk. Instead, Node.js returns the cached module.
7. Circular Dependencies: Be cautious with circular dependencies, where two or more modules require each other. Proper structuring and design can help avoid issues related to circular dependencies.
Node.js's module system and the `require` function are essential for creating modular and maintainable JavaScript code. They allow you to break your application into smaller, reusable components and organize your codebase efficiently.


-------
In Node.js, there are several ways to load modules, including loading file modules, modules from the `node_modules` folder, and folder-based modules. Here's how you can use each of these methods:
1. Loading File Modules:
   You can load modules from files by specifying a relative or absolute path to the module file. Here's an example of loading a file-based module:
   ```javascript
   // Loading a module from a relative path
   const myModule = require('./my-module.js');
   ```
   In this example, the `my-module.js` file is located in the same directory as the file that is loading it. You can use the `require` function to load modules from different directories or parent directories by adjusting the path accordingly.
2. Loading Modules from `node_modules`:
   When you install a package using NPM, it is typically stored in the `node_modules` folder of your project. You can load these modules by specifying the module name without a file path. Node.js will automatically look for the module in the `node_modules` folder. Here's an example:
   ```javascript
   // Loading a module from the node_modules folder
   const express = require('express');
   ```
   In this example, we're loading the `express` package, which is installed in the `node_modules` folder.
3. Loading Folder-Based Modules:
   You can also load modules from folders, which can be particularly useful for creating and organizing custom modules within your project. To load a module from a folder, you typically create an `index.js` file inside that folder, and Node.js will treat the folder as a module. Here's an example:
   ```javascript
   // Assume you have a folder named 'my-folder' with an 'index.js' file inside
   const myModule = require('./my-folder');
   ```
   In this case, Node.js will load the `index.js` file inside the `my-folder` directory as the module.
4. Using `require.resolve()` for Module Resolution:
   You can programmatically determine the resolved path of a module without actually loading it by using the `require.resolve()` method. This method returns the full path to the module that would be loaded using `require`. Here's an example:
   ```javascript
   // Resolve the path to the 'express' module
   const expressPath = require.resolve('express');
   console.log(expressPath);
   ```
   This can be useful when you want to inspect the resolved path or perform operations based on the module's location.
These methods give you flexibility in how you load modules in your Node.js application. You can choose the most appropriate method based on your project's structure and requirements.

os module
The `os` module in Node.js provides a set of operating system-related utility functions and information. It allows you to access various information about the operating system, such as platform-specific details, system uptime, CPU architecture, and more. You can use this module to create cross-platform applications and gather system-related information in your Node.js programs.

Here are some commonly used functionalities provided by the `os` module:
1. Platform Information:
   - `os.platform()`: Returns a string indicating the operating system platform (e.g., 'darwin' for macOS, 'win32' for Windows).
   - `os.arch()`: Returns a string representing the CPU architecture (e.g., 'x64', 'arm', 'ia32').
2. User Information:
   - `os.userInfo()`: Returns an object with information about the current user, including username, user ID, home directory, and shell.
3. System Uptime:
   - `os.uptime()`: Returns the system uptime in seconds.
   - `os.loadavg()`: Returns an array representing the average system load over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
4. CPU Information:
   - `os.cpus()`: Returns an array of objects, each representing a CPU core with details like model, speed, and times (CPU usage).
5. Memory Information:
   - `os.totalmem()`: Returns the total amount of system memory (RAM) in bytes.
   - `os.freemem()`: Returns the amount of free system memory in bytes.
6. Network Interfaces:
   - `os.networkInterfaces()`: Returns an object with information about network interfaces on the system, including IP addresses and related details.
7. Endianness:
   - `os.endianness()`: Returns the endianness of the CPU ('BE' for big-endian or 'LE' for little-endian).
8. Hostname:
   - `os.hostname()`: Returns the hostname of the operating system.
9. EOL (End-of-Line) Character:
   - `os.EOL`: A string containing the appropriate line-ending character(s) for the current platform (`'\n'` for Unix-like systems and `'\r\n'` for Windows).
Here's an example of how to use the `os` module to retrieve some basic system information:
```javascript
const os = require('os');

console.log('Platform:', os.platform());
console.log('CPU Architecture:', os.arch());
console.log('User Info:', os.userInfo());
console.log('System Uptime (seconds):', os.uptime());
console.log('Total Memory (bytes):', os.totalmem());
console.log('Free Memory (bytes):', os.freemem());
console.log('Network Interfaces:', os.networkInterfaces());
console.log('Endianness:', os.endianness());
console.log('Hostname:', os.hostname());
console.log('EOL Character:', os.EOL);
```
Keep in mind that the `os` module provides platform-specific information, so the results may vary depending on the operating system your Node.js application is running on.


---------
fs module
The `fs` module in Node.js stands for "File System," and it provides a set of functions and methods for interacting with the file system. With the `fs` module, you can perform various file operations, such as reading from and writing to files, creating directories, deleting files, and more. It is a built-in module in Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.

Here are some common operations and methods provided by the `fs` module:
1. Reading and Writing Files:
   - `fs.readFile()`: Reads the contents of a file asynchronously and provides the data in a callback function.
   - `fs.readFileSync()`: Reads the contents of a file synchronously and returns the data as a buffer or string.
   - `fs.writeFile()`: Writes data to a file asynchronously.
   - `fs.writeFileSync()`: Writes data to a file synchronously.
2. Working with Directories:
   - `fs.readdir()`: Reads the contents of a directory asynchronously and provides a list of files and subdirectories in a callback function.
   - `fs.mkdir()`: Creates a new directory asynchronously.
   - `fs.rmdir()`: Removes a directory asynchronously.
3. File and Directory Information:
   - `fs.stat()`: Retrieves information about a file or directory asynchronously.
   - `fs.lstat()`: Retrieves information about a file or directory, handling symbolic links asynchronously.
   - `fs.exists()`: Checks if a file or directory exists asynchronously.
4. Renaming and Moving Files:
   - `fs.rename()`: Renames a file or moves it to a different location asynchronously.
   - `fs.renameSync()`: Renames a file or moves it synchronously.
5. Deleting Files and Directories:
   - `fs.unlink()`: Deletes a file asynchronously.
   - `fs.unlinkSync()`: Deletes a file synchronously.
   - `fs.rmdir()`: Removes a directory asynchronously.
   - `fs.rmdirSync()`: Removes a directory synchronously.
6. Working with Streams:
   - `fs.createReadStream()`: Creates a readable stream to read data from a file.
   - `fs.createWriteStream()`: Creates a writable stream to write data to a file.
7. Permissions and Ownership:
   - `fs.chmod()`: Changes file permissions asynchronously.
   - `fs.chown()`: Changes file ownership asynchronously.
8. File Watchers:
   - `fs.watch()`: Watches for changes in a file or directory and triggers events when changes occur.
These are just some of the common operations you can perform using the `fs` module. The module provides a wide range of functionality for working with files and directories, making it a fundamental part of building file-related functionality in Node.js applications.


---------
http module
The `http` module in Node.js is a core module that provides the functionality to create HTTP servers and make HTTP requests. It allows you to build web servers, RESTful APIs, and interact with external web services. The `http` module is widely used for building web applications and services in Node.js.
Here are some of the key functionalities provided by the `http` module:
1. Creating an HTTP Server:
   - `http.createServer()`: You can use this method to create an HTTP server. You provide a callback function that is executed for each incoming HTTP request. Inside this callback function, you handle the request and send back a response.
   ```javascript
   const http = require('http');
   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
     res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
     res.end('Hello, World!\n');
   });
   const port = 3000;
   server.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```
2. Handling HTTP Requests and Responses:
   - The server callback function receives `req` (request) and `res` (response) objects as parameters. You can access request headers, URL, and data, and send a response back to the client.
   - `res.writeHead()`: Sets the response status code and headers.
   - `res.write()`: Writes data to the response.
   - `res.end()`: Ends the response and sends it to the client.
3. Making HTTP Requests:
   - `http.request()`: You can use this method to make HTTP requests to external servers or APIs. You specify the request method, URL, and options, and provide a callback function to handle the response.
   ```javascript
   const http = require('http');
   const options = {
     hostname: 'example.com',
     port: 80,
     path: '/api/data',
     method: 'GET',
   };
   const req = http.request(options, (res) => {
     let data = '';
     res.on('data', (chunk) => {
       data += chunk;
     });
     res.on('end', () => {
       console.log(data);
     });
   });
   req.end();
   ```
4. HTTPS Support:
   - Node.js also provides the `https` module, which is similar to the `http` module but supports making secure HTTPS requests and creating HTTPS servers. You use it in a similar way to the `http` module, with the addition of specifying SSL certificate options when creating HTTPS servers.
5. WebSockets and HTTP/2:
   - Node.js has support for WebSockets and HTTP/2 through separate modules (`websocket` and `http2`, respectively). These modules allow you to build real-time applications and use the latest HTTP protocol features.
The `http` module is a powerful tool for building web servers and making HTTP requests in Node.js. It forms the basis for many web frameworks and libraries in the Node.js ecosystem, making it essential for web development in Node.js.


---------
express module
The Express.js framework, commonly referred to as "Express," is a popular web framework for Node.js. It simplifies the development of web applications and APIs by providing a set of features and tools for routing, middleware, request handling, and more. Express is widely used in both small and large-scale web projects due to its simplicity and flexibility.
Key features and concepts of the Express.js framework include:
1. Routing: Express provides a straightforward and flexible routing system that allows you to define routes for handling HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). You can define route handlers to process incoming requests based on the URL path and HTTP method.
2. Middleware: Middleware functions in Express are a central part of request handling. Middleware can be used for tasks such as authentication, logging, data parsing, and response manipulation. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined in the application.
3. Request and Response Objects: Express enhances the Node.js `req` (request) and `res` (response) objects, providing additional methods and properties for handling HTTP requests and responses. This simplifies tasks like reading request data, setting response headers, and sending responses.
4. Template Engines: Express can be integrated with various template engines (such as EJS, Pug, or Handlebars) to render dynamic views and HTML pages on the server side. Template engines allow you to inject data into HTML templates to generate dynamic content.
5. Static Files: You can serve static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images) with Express using the `express.static` middleware. This simplifies serving assets like stylesheets and client-side scripts.
6. Middleware Ecosystem: Express has a rich ecosystem of third-party middleware packages available on NPM, making it easy to extend its functionality with features like authentication, session management, and more.
7. Error Handling: Express provides mechanisms for handling errors, both synchronous and asynchronous. You can define error-handling middleware functions to catch and process errors that occur during request processing.
8. RESTful APIs: Express is commonly used to build RESTful APIs due to its simple routing system and support for handling JSON data. It allows you to define resource-based routes and handle CRUD operations easily.
9. WebSockets: While not included in the core Express package, you can use WebSocket libraries like `socket.io` alongside Express to add real-time functionality to your applications.
10. Express Generator: Express offers a command-line tool called Express Generator that helps you scaffold a basic Express application structure, including the project's file and directory layout, templates, and configuration files.
Here's a simple example of an Express.js application:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
// Define a route and response
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});
// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Express server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```
In this example, we create an Express application, define a route that responds to requests at the root URL (`/`), and start the server on port 3000.

Express is a versatile framework suitable for various web development scenarios, from simple websites to complex APIs and microservices. Its extensive ecosystem and active community make it a popular choice among Node.js developers.

routing
is the process of determining the path or course that data should follow from a source to a destination. 
route -> path, routing -> determining path

Computer Networking: In computer networking, routing involves the process of forwarding data packets from the source device to the destination device through a series of network devices (routers) that make decisions about the optimal path based on routing protocols and network conditions.


In web development, routing specifically refers to the mechanism that determines how HTTP requests made by a client (typically a web browser) are handled and processed by a web server. Web routing defines which code or resources should respond to specific URLs or routes requested by clients. Here are some key aspects of web routing:
routing, mechanism used for handling http requests in web servers

1. URL Parsing: When a client makes an HTTP request to a web server, the URL included in the request is parsed to determine the requested resource or route. The URL typically includes a path, query parameters, and sometimes fragment identifiers.
2. Route Definitions: Web applications define routes, which are mappings between specific URLs and the code or resources that should handle those URLs. These definitions are often found in a routing configuration file or code.
3. Request Handling: When an HTTP request matches a defined route, the associated code or controller is responsible for processing the request. This can include generating dynamic content, retrieving data from a database, or performing other application-specific tasks.
4. HTTP Methods: Routing can also take into account the HTTP method used in the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Different routes may be defined for different HTTP methods, allowing for different actions to be taken based on the method.
5. Parameters: Routes can include parameters in the URL path or as query parameters. These parameters can be extracted and used in request processing.
6. Middleware: Many web frameworks and libraries allow for the use of middleware, which are functions or components that can be executed before or after request handling. Middleware can perform tasks like authentication, logging, or data manipulation.
7. Route Parameters: Some routes may have dynamic segments that act as placeholders for values. For example, in a URL like `/users/123`, `123` could be a dynamic user ID that is extracted and used by the route handler.
8. Route Redirects: Web routing can also handle route redirects, where certain URLs are redirected to others. This is commonly used for handling deprecated URLs or improving SEO.
9. Route Guards: In web applications, route guards can be used to control access to specific routes based on user authentication, authorization, or other conditions.


--------
cors
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. 
It is a security feature implemented by web browsers.
It restricts web pages from making requests to domains different from the one that served the web page. This restriction helps prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

origin: combination of a scheme (e.g., `http`, `https`), a hostname (e.g., `example.com`), and a port (e.g., `80`, `443`)
request: message sent by client to server to perform a task. request consists of request resource (URL) , request method (GET, POST etc), headers and data (from data or json etc)
response: is a message sent by a server to a client (typically a web browser) in response to an HTTP request. It includes information about the request's status (e.g., HTTP status code), headers, and the content of the response (e.g., HTML, JSON).

However, there are legitimate use cases where a web page from one domain needs to make requests to a different domain, such as when a front-end web application needs to communicate with a back-end API on a different server. In such cases, CORS headers must be configured correctly on the server to allow these cross-origin requests.

Here's how CORS works and how to handle it in a Node.js application:
1. HTTP Request with CORS:
   When a web page hosted on one domain makes an HTTP request to a different domain (cross-origin request), the browser sends an initial request to the server with an `Origin` header indicating the origin of the requesting web page.
2. CORS Policy on the Server:
   The server, which receives the request, can be configured to include appropriate CORS headers in its response. These headers define the CORS policy for the server.
   - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: Specifies which origins are allowed to access the resource. It can be set to a specific origin, `*` (allowing any origin), or a list of allowed origins.
   - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: Specifies which HTTP methods are allowed when accessing the resource.
   - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: Lists the HTTP headers that are allowed when making the actual request.
   - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: Indicates whether the browser should include credentials (e.g., cookies) in the request.
   - `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`: Lists which headers the browser should expose to the response.
   - `Access-Control-Max-Age`: Specifies how long the results of a preflight request (a preliminary request sent before the actual request) can be cached.
3. Preflight Request:
   For some cross-origin requests, browsers send a preflight request (an HTTP OPTIONS request) to check if the server allows the actual request. The server must respond to this preflight request with appropriate CORS headers.
4. Handling CORS in Node.js:
   To enable CORS in a Node.js application, you can use middleware packages such as `cors`. Here's how you can set up CORS middleware in an Express.js application:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const cors = require('cors');
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;
   // Enable CORS for all routes
   app.use(cors());
   // Your routes and application logic here
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```
   The `cors()` middleware in this example allows any origin to access your server's resources. You can configure it to be more restrictive by specifying specific origins, methods, and headers.
CORS is a crucial security feature that must be correctly configured to ensure that your web application can make cross-origin requests to external servers or APIs while still protecting against potential security threats

---
In the context of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), the terms "origin," "request," and "response" are important concepts. CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control which web pages can make requests to different origins (domains) and how those requests and responses are handled.

Let's break down these terms:
1. Origin:
   - An "origin" in web security refers to the combination of a scheme (e.g., `http`, `https`), a hostname (e.g., `example.com`), and a port (e.g., `80`, `443`). For example, `https://example.com` and `http://localhost:3000` are two different origins.
   - The "origin" is used to identify the source of a web page, and it's a fundamental part of the CORS mechanism. Browsers use the origin of the requesting web page to determine if a cross-origin request should be allowed or blocked.
2. Request:
   - An "HTTP request" refers to a message sent by a client (typically a web browser) to a server, asking the server to perform an action. HTTP requests include various information, such as the requested resource (URL), request method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), headers, and any data (e.g., form data or JSON) that the client wants to send to the server.
   - In the context of CORS, a "cross-origin request" is an HTTP request initiated by a web page from one origin (e.g., `https://example.com`) to a different origin (e.g., `https://api.example.com`). Browsers enforce CORS policies to determine whether to allow or block these requests.
3. Response:
   - An "HTTP response" is a message sent by a server to a client (typically a web browser) in response to an HTTP request. It includes information about the request's status (e.g., HTTP status code), headers, and the content of the response (e.g., HTML, JSON).
   - In the context of CORS, the "CORS response headers" are the headers sent by the server to the client to define its CORS policy. These headers specify which origins are allowed to access the resource, which HTTP methods are permitted, whether credentials (e.g., cookies) can be included in the request, and other CORS-related settings.
   - If the server's CORS policy allows the request, the browser will pass the response back to the web page's JavaScript code. If the policy does not allow the request, the browser will block it, and the JavaScript code on the web page will not have access to the response.

To summarize, in the context of CORS:
- An "origin" is the combination of a scheme, hostname, and port that identifies the source of a web page.
- A "request" is an HTTP message sent by the client (usually a web browser) to the server, and a "cross-origin request" is a request from one origin to a different origin.
- A "response" is an HTTP message sent by the server to the client in response to a request, and "CORS response headers" are headers that define the server's CORS policy for allowing or blocking cross-origin requests.

---
Here's an example that illustrates a cross-origin request and response using CORS in a simplified manner. In this example, we'll assume that you have a front-end web page hosted on `https://frontend.example.com` making a request to a back-end API hosted on `https://api.example.com`. We'll provide a basic request and response message for each side.

Front-End (Request):
Suppose you have JavaScript code running in a web page hosted on `https://frontend.example.com`. Your JavaScript code might make an XMLHttpRequest (XHR) or use the Fetch API to send a request to the API on a different origin:

```javascript
const apiUrl = 'https://api.example.com/data';
fetch(apiUrl, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Origin': 'https://frontend.example.com',
  },
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data); // Process the API response
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

Back-End (Response
On the server side, hosted at `https://api.example.com`, you would configure your server to handle this request and send the appropriate CORS headers in the response:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Enable CORS middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'https://frontend.example.com'); // Allow only this origin
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE');
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true'); // Allow credentials (e.g., cookies)
  next();
});

// Define a route to handle the API request
app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
  // Simulate sending JSON data as the response
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from the API!' });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

Explanation:
- The front-end code sends an HTTP GET request to `https://api.example.com/data` and includes an `Origin` header set to `https://frontend.example.com` to indicate the source of the request.
- The back-end server (Express.js in this case) includes CORS headers in the response:
   - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` specifies that only `https://frontend.example.com` is allowed to access the resource. If the front-end origin doesn't match this value, the browser will block the request.
   - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` lists the allowed HTTP methods.
   - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` specifies which headers are allowed in the request.
   - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` allows credentials (e.g., cookies) to be included in the request when set to `'true'`.
When the front-end code makes the request, the browser checks the CORS headers in the response. If the server allows the request based on the CORS policy, the browser passes the response data back to the front-end code for further processing.
This example demonstrates the basic structure of a cross-origin request and response with CORS headers. In practice, the headers may be more complex depending on the specific requirements and security considerations of your application.



--------
mvc architecture

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a design pattern commonly used in software development, particularly for building web applications. It separates an application into three interconnected components, each with its own distinct role and responsibility:
1. Model (M): - encapsulates and manipulates data
   - The Model represents the application's data and business logic.
   - It encapsulates the data, performs data manipulation and validation, and responds to queries from the View and Controller.
   - The Model is responsible for maintaining the integrity and consistency of the data.
   - Changes to the Model trigger notifications or events to inform the View and Controller.
2. View (V): renders data
   - The View is responsible for presenting the user interface and displaying data to the user.
   - It listens for updates from the Model and displays the data accordingly.
   - The View does not contain application logic or perform data manipulation; it simply renders the data.
   - In web applications, the View is often implemented as HTML templates, and it can also include JavaScript for user interactivity.
3. Controller (C):
   - The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View.
   - It handles user input and initiates actions based on that input.
   - The Controller receives user interactions from the View and processes them, often by invoking methods on the Model.
   - It updates the Model based on user input and instructs the View to display updated data.
   - In web applications, the Controller is often responsible for routing and handling HTTP requests.
The MVC architecture promotes the separation of concerns, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale applications. It enhances modularity and code reusability, as changes to one component can be made independently of the others. Additionally, MVC facilitates collaboration among development teams, as developers can work on different components simultaneously.
Here's a simplified example of how MVC might be implemented in a web application:
- Model: Represents the application's data and business logic. It communicates with a database to fetch and store data. For example, in a blog application, the Model might include functions to fetch and save blog posts.
- View: Represents the user interface and templates for rendering data. In a blog application, the View could be responsible for rendering blog posts as HTML pages and displaying them to users.
- Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It handles user requests, such as viewing a blog post, creating a new post, or updating an existing one. The Controller invokes the appropriate methods in the Model and instructs the View to render the response.
MVC is a widely adopted architectural pattern and serves as the foundation for many web frameworks and libraries, such as Ruby on Rails, Django, Laravel, and Express.js. While MVC is a powerful pattern, it has evolved into variations such as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and Model-View-Presenter (MVP) to address specific needs and technologies.

--
Creating a full-fledged Node.js MVC (Model-View-Controller) application from scratch can be a complex task. However, I'll provide a simplified example of an MVC-like structure in Node.js to give you an idea of how it can be organized. In this example, we won't use a web framework like Express, but we'll build a basic MVC structure manually.
Here's the structure of the project:
```
mvc-example/
  ├── controllers/
  │   └── blogController.js
  ├── models/
  │   └── blogModel.js
  ├── views/
  │   └── blogView.js
  ├── app.js
  └── package.json
```
1. Create a `models/blogModel.js` file:
   This represents the Model in our MVC architecture. It will define a simple data structure for blog posts.
   ```javascript
   // models/blogModel.js
   const posts = [
     { id: 1, title: 'First Post', content: 'This is the content of the first post.' },
     { id: 2, title: 'Second Post', content: 'This is the content of the second post.' },
   ];

   module.exports = {
     getAllPosts: () => posts,
     getPostById: (id) => posts.find((post) => post.id === id),
   };
   ```
2. Create a `views/blogView.js` file:
   This represents the View in our MVC architecture. It will define how to render the blog posts to the console.
   ```javascript
   // views/blogView.js
   module.exports = {
     renderPosts: (posts) => {
       posts.forEach((post) => {
         console.log(`Title: ${post.title}`);
         console.log(`Content: ${post.content}`);
         console.log('---');
       });
     },
   };
   ```
3. Create a `controllers/blogController.js` file:
   This represents the Controller in our MVC architecture. It will handle the logic for retrieving data from the Model and rendering it with the View.

   ```javascript
   // controllers/blogController.js
   const blogModel = require('../models/blogModel');
   const blogView = require('../views/blogView');
   module.exports = {
     getAllPosts: () => {
       const posts = blogModel.getAllPosts();
       blogView.renderPosts(posts);
     },
   };
   ```
4. Create an `app.js` file:
   This is the entry point of our application. It will import the Controller and call its methods to display the blog posts.
   ```javascript
   // app.js
   const blogController = require('./controllers/blogController');
   // Call the Controller to get and render all blog posts
   blogController.getAllPosts();
   ```
5. Install Required Packages:
   In your project directory, run the following command to initialize a `package.json` file and install the `colors` package for console styling (optional but makes the output more visually appealing):
   ```
   npm init -y
   npm install colors
   ```
6. Run the Application:
   Run the application using Node.js:
   ```
   node app.js
   ```
   You should see the blog posts displayed in the console.

This example demonstrates a basic separation of concerns following the MVC pattern. In a real-world application, you would typically use a web framework like Express.js to handle routing, HTTP requests, and more, but the fundamental concepts of separating Model, View, and Controller would remain similar. 




-------------
CommonJS (Common JavaScript) is a module system and specification for organizing and structuring JavaScript code in a modular and reusable way. It was originally developed for server-side JavaScript, particularly in the context of the Node.js runtime. The primary goal of CommonJS is to allow JavaScript code to be divided into small, manageable modules that can be easily imported and used in other parts of an application.

Here are the key features and concepts of CommonJS:

1. **Module Definition**: CommonJS defines a module as a separate JavaScript file, where each file encapsulates a piece of functionality or code. Modules are the building blocks of CommonJS applications.

2. **Exports and Require**: CommonJS introduces two fundamental functions for working with modules:
   - `require()`: Used to import (or "require") a module and make its functionality available in the current module.
   - `exports`: An object that allows a module to expose its functionality to other modules. You can add properties and functions to `exports` to make them accessible when the module is required elsewhere.

3. **Synchronous Loading**: One key characteristic of CommonJS modules is that they are loaded synchronously. When you use `require()`, the module is loaded and executed immediately, and its exports are available for use.

4. **Caching**: CommonJS modules are cached after the first load. If the same module is required again in another part of the application, Node.js will return the cached module instead of reloading it. This helps improve performance and avoids circular dependencies.

Here's a simple example of a CommonJS module and how it can be used:

**myModule.js** (A CommonJS module):

```javascript
// Define a module with exports
const greet = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

// Export the greet function
exports.greet = greet;
```

**main.js** (Another CommonJS module):

```javascript
// Require the myModule.js module
const myModule = require('./myModule');

// Use the exported function
console.log(myModule.greet('Alice')); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

CommonJS is widely used in server-side JavaScript, especially in Node.js applications, where it provides a clean and organized way to structure code. However, it's important to note that CommonJS is primarily designed for synchronous module loading, which may not be ideal for all use cases, particularly in modern web development where asynchronous loading and bundling are common practices. As a result, in web development, tools like Webpack and ES6 modules (import/export) have gained popularity for managing JavaScript modules.
